The main idea of this project is to practice using the flexbox and it's properties to style the page.

Besides practicing flexbox I've also got the chance to: 
* Add <b>:hover</b> and <b>:onclick</b> selecotors on the buttons, which made them change color when either are or are active. Ultimately I removed the :hover selector as it wasn't suitable in this case.
* Add a <b>cursor</b> property with value <b>pointer</b> to the buttons to show the user that it's an active button that can be clicked.
* Add a pseudo-class <b>:first-child</b> to the first paragraph in the Call to action section so I can apply a different font weight to it.
* Add rounded corners via <b>border-radius</b> property to a bunch of elements.
